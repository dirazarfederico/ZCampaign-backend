# ZCampaign-backend
Backend for a donations management system.

# Business problem
ZCampaign helps track donation campaigns for institutions such as meal centers or pre-schools.

A town's citizens can request pickup and the institution's staff can be assigned for delivery.  
A pickup request turns into a pickup order when assigned to a staff member.  
When the cargo is delivered, a donation is logged.

The institution can manage their staff.

# Architecture
Applies an MVC design pattern.

# Data
Stores data in a MySQL database. Accesses it via JDBC.
